Bamazon storefront

## Overview
This CLI application is an Amazon-like storefront that allows you to purchase items by item id.

The prompts will ask which item id and quantity you would like to purchase.  After selecting the quantity, the total of the purchase will populate, and the stock will be depleted by the quantity you selected.

If the quantity is unavailable, or if the item id you selected does not exist, the purchase will be cancelled.
